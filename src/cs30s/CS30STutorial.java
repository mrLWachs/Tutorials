         * to create multiple "cookies". The two words: "class" and "object"

     * NOTE... We will now be adding another Java "class" file to the project
     * to work on (the "CarSelect" class we referenced above). To do this, 
     * go to "File - New File..." then select "Swing GUI Forms" then select 
     * "JFrame form" (Java uses the words "frame" and "form" interchangeably).
     * This will open a new code tab, but also change NetBeans to look more
     * like visual Studio with a visual designer, a toolbox to add objects and
     * a properties window to change the properties of the objects. At the top 
     * of the tab are buttons to switch between "Source" (the code) and 
     * "Design" (the GUI designer). Like Visual Studio, you can double click 
     * things like buttons to get to the associated code, but you can also 
     * "right click" objects then select "Events" and navigate to the 
     * associated code event.
